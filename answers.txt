a)  The Product Manager is equivalent to the Product Owner. The roles of the Software Project Manager include 
    planning, execution, time manageent, budget, and maintenance. When planning the project manager must scope, 
    manage resources, create a timeline, and plan for testing and maintenance. For execution, the project manager 
    must supervise the team, have team check-ins, and status reports. For their time management role, they must have 
    risk management and status reports. For budgeting, they must moderate spending and re-allocate funds. Finally 
    their maintenance role includes discovering and fixing bugs through testing and make any changes that the customer 
    wants.

b)  The Scrum Master acts as a facilitator and leader, removing obstacles and creating a productive team environment.
    The Product Owner represents stakeholders, defines and prioritizes features in the product backlog, and makes decisions 
    to maximize the product's value. Both roles collaborate closely to support the success of the Scrum team.
